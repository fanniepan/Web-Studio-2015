The website I am designing is a portfolio of all the works as a UX Designer. I hope to encapture all of the designs and projects I have done so far into the website. I want to do this project so that I can provide clients a medium where they can see my works. The things I want to include into the website include a brief summary of myself, my work, my resume, and contact information.
My target audience would be those who want to hire a UX Designer or Project Designer for their projects or company. People will come to the site to see what skills I can provide.
